# Visualisations 
Classes and functions to speed up plotting of data spatially, on graphs, etc. 

TODO:
- [ ] Add more documentation on how to use the scripts
- [ ] Add more methods for visualisation (e.g. time series, etc)
- [ ] Add clever visualisation for, e.g.,:
  - decoding ADS-B; 
  - verification with bits/info-gain; 
  - gauging importance in machine-learning procedures
- [ ] Interactivity... maybe a spin-off repo.
