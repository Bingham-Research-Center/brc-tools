## Research Applications

### 1. Basin-Scale Meteorology

#### Drainage Flow Analysis
**Objective**: Quantify cold air drainage patterns in the Uinta Basin during inversion events

**Current Capabilities**:
- HRRR 3km resolution provides surface meteorology
- AQM captures pollution buildup during inversions
- Station observations validate model performance

**Research Extensions**:
```python
class DrainageFlowAnalysis:
    """Analyze cold air drainage patterns using high-resolution NWP."""
    
    def __init__(self, basin_bounds, inversion_criteria):
        self.basin_bounds = basin_bounds
        self.inversion_criteria = inversion_criteria
    
    def identify_inversion_events(self, temperature_profile):
        """Detect temperature inversions from model soundings."""
        # Detect layers where temperature increases with height
        pass
    
    def calculate_drainage_flow(self, wind_data, terrain_data):
        """Calculate downslope flow components."""
        # Vector analysis of wind relative to terrain slope
        pass

        """Quantify pollution accumulation potential."""
        # Ventilation coefficient analysis
        pass
```

**Theoretical Applications**:
- **Ventilation Coefficients**: Automated calculation of mixing height Ã— wind speed
- **Flow Convergence Zones**: Identify where drainage flows meet and pollutants accumulate
- **Residence Time Analysis**: Track air parcel movement and stagnation
- **Terrain Interaction**: Quantify how topography channels and redirects flows

#### Inversion Climatology
**Research Questions**:
- How frequently do strong inversions occur? (strength, duration, extent)
- What synoptic patterns favor inversion development?
- How do inversions break down? (solar heating, wind mixing, large-scale forcing)

**Advanced Analytics**:

    """Multi-year analysis of inversion patterns."""
    
    def characterize_inversion_strength(self, temperature_profiles):

    def tagged_tracer_analysis(self, emission_sectors):
        """Track contributions from specific source types."""
